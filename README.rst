    Read the NotebookForCode


Each file_index corresponds to an image file. The notebook gives a visual representation of the data. The data is stored in a dictionary with the following keys:

    - 'image': the image data
    - 'label': the label of the image
    - 'filename': the filename of the image
    - 'file_index': the index of the image in the dataset
    - 'dataset': the dataset the image belongs to
    - 'dataset_index': the index of the image in the dataset
The dataset are uploaded on DataFed with id 	d/501306946 for the Bounding Boxes and d/501306069 for the Images.
I will provide an easier  access to data in the future but email is da886@drexel.edu for now.
